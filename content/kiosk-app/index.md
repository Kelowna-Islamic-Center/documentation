# Kiosk App Overview

The **KIC Kiosk App** is a SvelteKit-based web application deployed on dedicated display kiosks inside the masjid.

Its purpose is to provide the community with real-time athan and iqamah times aswell as announcements all in a modern and automated format that syncs with the mobile app.

The previous solution to prayer time displays at the masjid was with a manual digital clock that would require adjustment every week or so. The kiosk app replaces this system with a centrally managed, cloud solution that automatically syncs prayer times and announcmeents from the server.
